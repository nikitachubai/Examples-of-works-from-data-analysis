# Dataset Processing and Artificial Neural Network Training

This lab uses a dataset of numerical values from transformed speech recordings of 188 Parkinson's patients (107 men, 81 women, aged 33–87) and 64 healthy controls (23 men, 41 women, aged 41–82). Recordings of the vowel /a/ were processed using speech signal algorithms (MFCC, wavelet transforms, etc.) to extract features for classification, aiming to predict the presence or absence of Parkinson's-related speech impairment.
