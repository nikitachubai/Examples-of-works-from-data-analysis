# Methods of Preliminary Data Processing in Machine Learning

## Laboratory Work Overview
This repository contains laboratory works related to preliminary data processing techniques in machine learning. The main focus of the course is to develop skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and data cleaning before applying machine learning models. The datasets used in the assignments are primarily from the medical domain, allowing us to practice handling real-world data with common preprocessing challenges.

## Course Objectives
The objective of this course is to learn how to process and prepare data for machine learning applications. While the course does not cover big data processing techniques, it provides a strong foundation in essential preprocessing methods, such as:
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Feature selection and extraction
- Data normalization and standardization
- Encoding categorical variables
- Handling imbalanced datasets

## Laboratory Works
The following datasets were used in our laboratory assignments:
- **Laboratory_workshop 1:diabetes_rehospitalization** – Analysis of repeated hospitalizations for diabetes patients.
- **NU_LR_3(diabetes_puma).csv** – Diabetes dataset with regional (PUMA) data.
- **NU_LR_4(agaricus-lepiota).csv** – Classification of mushroom edibility.
- **NU_LR_6(parkinson_speech).csv** – Speech signal analysis for Parkinson’s disease detection.
- **NU_LR_7(roscomnadzor).csv** – Analysis of regulatory data.
- **UP Preprocessing of data for NSU (corrected version).**

These assignments allowed us to apply various preprocessing techniques and prepare datasets for machine learning models. The focus was on transforming raw data into a suitable format for model training while addressing common challenges encountered in real-world data science tasks.
